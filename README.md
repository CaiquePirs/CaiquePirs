# 👋 Hello There! I'm Caique Pires

## 💼 Backend Software Developer

I'm a junior software developer focused on building robust and scalable backend solutions with Java and Spring. I have experience in RESTful APIs, integration with relational and non-relational databases, authentication and authorization with Spring Security and JWT, messaging with RabbitMQ, as well as testing with JUnit and Mockito. I work with Docker, Swagger/OpenAPI, and monitoring with Spring Actuator. I have knowledge of microservices architecture, hexagonal architecture, layered architecture, and clean architecture. Passionate about technology, I apply SOLID principles, design patterns, and best development practices to deliver clean, secure, and efficient code.
